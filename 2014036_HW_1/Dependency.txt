So I have done the assignment in Python. To run the code INSTALL ANACONDA on your computer from the link https://www.continuum.io/downloads, if you don't have it installed. It is a platform to easily run python codes on Windows or Ubuntu where we can install libraries easily or have predefied libraries. Then open spyder and run the code on console.

So, it allows to have dependencies preinstalled, which is needed for the assignment.
